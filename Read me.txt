py Files
- ILSS_main: It is a main file of ILSS. When the "Iteration", "X_train", and "X_test" files are ready, run "ILSS_main".
- Base: It contains class and function which create a primitive set and tree.
- Constant_optimization: The functions for constant optimization are included here.
- Evaluation: The functions for evaluation are included here.
- Initialization: The functions for initialization are included here.
- Library_manager: The functions for generating semantic cluster library are included here.
- Module_wide_function: You can add user-function here.
- Module_wide_variable: You can change parameter values here.
- Operator: The semantic cluster operator and related functions are included here.
- Selection: The functions for selection are included here.

excel Files:
Iteration: It contains values of parameters. You should specify the parameter values at first to run ILSS.
1_train: This is an example of training data. You should name the training data as an "X_train", where X should be the same as the value in "The_name_of_data_set".
1_test: This is an example of testing data. You should name the testing data as an "X_test", where X should be the same as the value in "The_name_of_data_set".

How to run ILSS?

1. Specify the values of parameters in the "Iteration" file.
2. Create "X_train", and "X_test" file.
3. Run "ILSS_main".
